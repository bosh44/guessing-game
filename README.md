[Guessing Game Repository](http://github.com/bosh44/guessing-game/)


This project is a little bash game made for the Unix Workbench course. This repository contains a makefile, this README.md file and a small bash script.


### The script will:
* ask you how many files there are in the current directory.
* take your guess.
* tell you if your guess is high or low.
* tell if your guess is right.





Lines in script:
32
